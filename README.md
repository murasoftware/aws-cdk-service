# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project!

This is a blank project for JavaScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

It's set up so that all you need to do is copy this repo, change the package.json name and update the handler export in the /resources/index.js.  You can then run the commands below to deploy it.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
