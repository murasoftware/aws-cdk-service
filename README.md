# Welcome to your CDK Serverless project!

This is a example project for JavaScript development with CDK to deploy a Lambda behind an API Gateway

It's set up so that all you need to do is copy this repo, change the package.json name and update the handler export in the /resources/index.js.  You can then run the commands below to deploy it.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
